The Adventures of C Program
It was a bright morning. C Program woke up and checked if (time == 9AM) then he would go to work. C worked as a coder at a tech company. 
While C was walking to work, he thought about the tasks for today. His boss asked him to implement some new functions for their software. C needed to design the functions, define the arguments, return the values and make sure no errors occurred. 
When C arrived at the office, he turned on his computer and began to code. He wrote:
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
char name[50]; 
printf("Please enter your name: ");
scanf("%s", name); 
print("Hello %s! Welcome.", name);
if (age > 0 && age < 120){
   print("Your age is %d.", age);
}else{
   print("Invalid age!");
}
float height;
printf("Please enter your height (cm): ");
scanf("%f", &height); 
switch(gender){
   case 'm':
   printf("Male");
   break;
   case 'f':
   printf("Female");
   break;
   default:
   printf("Invalid"); 
}
}
While C was coding, he sipped some coffee and took a break when he was tired. By the end of the day, his functions were finished. C felt content and looked forward to more work the next day.
The end.
